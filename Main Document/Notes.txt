Notes

 - Consider using consistent notation for RBMs
 	- Consider defining notation before each figure
 	- Consider \theta = {W, b} notation
 - Consider adding an example of a neural network trained to ~2% error
 - Consider showings images examples of MNIST of RBM and DAE
 - Consider adding matrix factorization method
 - Consider adding an image showing the manifold learning intuition for DAE
 - Need to add binary conditional probability for RBM
 - Consider adding more content to fill the space created
 	by figures

 - Add results
